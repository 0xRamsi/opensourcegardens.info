## Our vision

We create [Open Source Gardens][1] and connect people via Open Source (philosophy, seeds, software & hardware) in a horticultural and creative way. In our gardens and in community gardens we plant Open Source Seeds - seeds that are available to all people as public good (commons). We use Open Source technologies to support our activities .

We want to learn with and from each other and exchange ideas about gardening and open source. Through our exchanges we like to get to know each other and grow together into a strong community. In the garden and online. [Join us!][2]
